## Setup Instructions

1.  Clone the repository (or ensure all files are in your project directory).

2.  Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3.  Activate the virtual environment:
    -   Windows:
        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    -   Unix/MacOS:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

4.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5.  Create migration files:
    ```bash
    python manage.py makemigrations portfolio
    ```
    *!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Note: If `python manage.py makemigrations` doesn't detect changes, specifically target the app: `python manage.py makemigrations portfolio`*

6.  Apply migrations to create the database tables:
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

7.  Create a superuser for accessing the Django admin site:
    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```
    Follow the prompts to create a username, email, and password.

8.  Ensure models are registered in `portfolio/admin.py` to appear in the Django admin site.
    *(This was done automatically if you used the provided files)*

9.  Run the development server:
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

10. Access the website:
    -   Main site: `http://localhost:8000/`
    -   Current Work: `http://localhost:8000/current-work/`
